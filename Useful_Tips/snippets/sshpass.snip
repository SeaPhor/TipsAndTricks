Use sshpass:

sshpass -p "password" scp -r user@example.com:/some/remote/path /some/local/path
or so the password does not show in the bash history

sshpass -f "/path/to/passwordfile" scp -r user@example.com:/some/remote/path /some/local/path
The above copies contents of path from the remote host to your local.
