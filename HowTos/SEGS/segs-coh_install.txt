  347  sudo zypper in libqt5-qtbase libqt5-qttools libqt5-qttools-32bit libqt5-qttools-devel libqt5-qttools-devel-32bit

2. Get the project [ A. GUI or B. CLI ]
  A. GUI
    1. Start QTCreator and select New Project. The New Project dialog box will appear. From the list on the left, select [Import Project], and from the middle column [Git Clone], then press the [Choose...] button at the bottom right of the dialog window.
    In the new Git Clone dialog box enter in the GitHub repository for SEGS [https://github.com/Segs/Segs.git], and select the local folder where you'd like to store your copy of the SEGS repository.
    Select Next to clone a copy of the SEGS repo, and when completed select Finish to complete this step.
    2. Configure Project
    Next, QTCreator will ask you to configuration your project. This is where you'll select which development kit to use and define the paths for temporary build files.
    QTCreator uses kits to group various settings for building and running projects.
    Begin by selecting MinGW 32bit. 
[ I had to manually type {copy/paste} that into the "Add" seletion on the right]
    Finally, click Configure Project.
    3. Build All
    If everything went well, you'll see the SEGS file tree in the Projects Pane of QTCreator.
    Now, select Build > Build All from the menu at the top of QTCreator. The bottom half of the window will show compiling output as SEGS builds. The first time you build SEGS it may take several minutes and the output window may show hundreds of warnings, but if compiled successfully, you'll see the following in the Compile Output window.
[100%] Built target authserver
00:00:00: The process 'cmake' exited normally.
[ I had 235 issues 1 error 152 warnings ]
  B. CLI
mkdir Myrepos
cd !$
git clone https://github.com/Segs/Segs.git
cd Segs/
mkdir build
cd !$
cmake ..
make -j
echo $?
[ If output is other than "0" then errors ]

For Game box (and server)
