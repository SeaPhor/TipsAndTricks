Scenario:
	The Wood-Bee Company (WBC) network needs to provide a platform to replace some existing Servers, and for some new services. Stand up a new computer and configure it per the Stages.

Objective:
	To complete each Stage and be tested and pass successfully before moving on to the next Stage.

Prerequisites:
	Computer-
		◦ Hard Drive space => 30-40GB minimum free space, recommend 60GB free
		◦ Memory => 4GB Minimum (can still manage with 2GB but will be slow & wont be able to have anything else running) Recommend at least 8GB
	Software-
		◦ VirtualBox (Oracle) or Vmware (I recommend and use VirtualBox)
		    ▪ https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
		◦ Latest release of GeckoLinux or OpenSUSE-Leap (for this training GeckoLinux is perfect and Light-Weight)
		    ▪ GeckoLinux => https://sourceforge.net/projects/geckolinux/files/Static/422.170302/GeckoLinux_Gnome.x86_64-422.170302.0.iso/download
		    ▪ OpenSUSE-Leap (At time of this release) => https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap
		◦ ISO Image Burning software (“Windows disk image burner” built-in application is fine)
	Optional- (But recommended)
		◦ Any form of external (or internal) additional storage for any files or notes you may want to keep and or use in the future.
		◦ Hardware-
		    ▪ DVD-R (if OpenSUSE, CD-R if GeckoLinux) OR USB-Stick for ISO-Image

Stages:
Stage 00- Setup
	    1. On Your Own
		1. Download the ISO for the Linux version you wish to use.
		2. Download and install the VM software
		3. Run the VM software => New => Linux => OpenSUSE-64bit
		    1. HDD => 30-40GB (25GB Min.)
		    2. Memory => 2GB Minimum
		    3. Most other options remain the Default
	    2. While in communication via IRC
		1. Start the new vm and point the image path to where you downloaded the ISO-Image
		2. Move to Stage 01
